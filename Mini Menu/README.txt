# MFSRP Mini Menu

A super simple vMenu based menu resource that you can use to make stuff easier when trying to navagate your way through your FiveM server vMenu. No database, no fiddling with files and no restarting the resource required. Just a basic menu.

### Who is this for?
This is great for when you are running a small server for your friends or just need a server to test something on, and you don't wanna spend those extra 10 seconds or you don't wanna select certain things each time. There are other scripts out there that basically do the same,and better, but I just wanted to try it out a see what it's like :)

### Features:

Heal yourself tab,
On duty as a civilian script ( You can try to fix it, i will fix it at a later date ),
Basic Civilian Car spawn ( Just replace the "cammry18" with whatever spawn code from your server you want ),
A tab to select a loadout ( Basic CIVILIAN guns ),
And more to come!

### How to use it
Make sure that it is extracted using WinRAR, WinZIP or 7ZIP whatever you use.

Drop into your resources folder.

Add "start simplewhitelist" to your server cfg or your txadmin "CFG Editor"

Done!
